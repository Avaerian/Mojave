# Mojave
Welcome to Mojave, the open-source game engine written in Java!
Mojave is written with developer extensions in-mind, offering a nifty API for quickly creating a game or application.
The game engine is currently in an **early developmental phase**.

### Engine Service System
The game engine is based off of a service system where different core functionalities, such as the application window, audio and rendering systems, are different services that you can use. If a service is unable to be initialized, the service will be marked as disabled, however your program can continue to run if you choose. Dependent services will also be unusable.

### Why use Mojave?
Mojave provides a simple-to-use, comprehensive developer API that automates more tedious features.
